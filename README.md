# A Discord Dragalia Bot!

This bot is for retrieving information on characters from the Nintendo game, Dragalia Lost.
Unfortunately, the game has now shut down but the bot still works!

You can input any character or dragon and it will pull up their name, stats, element, weapon, skills, co-abilities, and abilities!

## How to use

Just add the bot to your Discord server and type `!dl charactername` or `!dl dragonname`.
It's that simple!
